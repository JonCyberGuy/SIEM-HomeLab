<h1>Microsoft Sentinel Live Attack Demonstration Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This is a walkthrough of how I used Microsoft Azure and created a virtual machine in the cloud running Windows 10. I exposed a VM to the internet and used Azure Log Analytics Workspace, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and Azure Sentinel to collect and aggregate the attack data and display it on a map in Microsoft Sentinel. This project will showcase the use of a few different tools and resources. I will be using PowerShell to scan EventViewer in the exposed VM, specifically EventID 4625 which is failed logon attempts, and send that data to a logfile. The PowerShell Script also sends the IP address from any failed logons to IPgeolocation.io via an API, so later that information can be used Microsoft Sentinel to map where the logon attempts originated from. This project was done to gain experience with SIEMs, cloud concepts and resources, API's, and Microsoft Azure.I learned how to provision and configure resources in the cloud, how to read SIEM logs and much more. This was a fun project and I hope anyone reading this appreciates the work that went into this project.<b/>

<b>The first thing I am going to do is create a Microsoft Azure account, this will be the cloud environment I'll use to provision my resources. I will take advantage of the $200 credit I'll receive to do this project. The resources I'm using are not very resource heavy, so my credit can be used towards future projects</b> <br/>

<b>The next thing I'll do is start the process of creating my virtual machines. Provisioning a VM can be a long process so while I move on to the next step, my VM can be provisioned in the background.</b> <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>At this point in the VM creation process I need to make sure that I create a new Resource Group that all of my future resources will be under. A resource group in Azure is a logical grouping of tools, services, configurations and more that exist under one banner so they can be created and deleted at the same time (they share the same lifespan). If I have resources outside of a particular resource group, if I delete that resource group the ones outside of it will still exist. It makes it easier to manage your resources if they're all in the same place. I decided to name this resource group "HoneyPot_Lab" and I name the virtual machine "HoneyPot-VM".</b>

<b>I scroll down on that same page and I now have to choose the size of the VM I'm going to provision. In the photo I initially chose Standard_B1s, as circled in green. Later on I decided to upgrade it to Standard_B2s which gave 2 CPU cores instead of 1 and more RAM. The first one I chose was just too slow. PowerShell kept crashing and the VM was lagging a lot. After choosing the size of the VM I create the Admin account. I chose a unique admin name and a 30 character password made up of special characters, numbers, and a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters. Since I knew people would be trying to log into the exposed VM, most likely through brute forcing and dictionary attacks a strong password was a necessity. The public inbound port rules, essentially which ports will be open to be able to connect to the VM. At this step you can set mutltiple authentication methods like SSH but I chose to only allow RDP. RDP uses port 3389.</b> <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>The next step is to create a new Network Security Group (NSG). An NSG is basically a Firewall that can create and enforce rules on inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources. For this project we don't want any rules on traffic. We want to allow anyone and everyone to be able to communicate with the honeypot VM. There is a default inbound rule, so we'll delete that one and create a new inbound rule that will allow EVERYTHING into the VM. On the Destination Port Ranges box I wrote an asterisk (*) for Anything. This will allow for any port ranges. We'll allow any protocol. For Priority, I set it at 100 because the lower the number the higher the priority. So if there is a rogue rule somewhere, this rule will have priority over it. With these rules set it will allow any and all traffic into our VM. I would NEVER EVER do this in a real production environment.</b> <br/>

<b>Now that everything is set up in the Azure dashboard, I can go into my VM and set setting things up there.

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>After I'm successfully logged into the VM via RDP, I navigate to Event Viewer. Event Viewer logs everything that goes on in a windows system. It gives each action an EventID so it can be more easily navigated or browsed by the EventID. For this project we are concerned specifically with EventID 4625, which is Failed Logon Attempts. These logs can be found in the Security tab. In the pictures below, I run another instance of Remote Desktop and try to log into the VM with the wrong password. This creates a failed logon attempt which is then logged and recorded in Event Viewer.</b> <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>The next step is the ping the VM from my native computer. I do this to see if I can make a direct connection to the VM and see if it is currently discoverable. It is not. That is because the VM has Windows Defender Firewall activated. The firewall is blocking ICMP Echo Requests, making the VM undiscoverable. I know this because I pinged the VM's public IP address which is 74.235.173.155 and I see Request timed out a few times. The firewall is dropping the ICMP request packets.</b> <br/>

<br />
<br />
<p align="center">
<b>To make sure that everyone on the internet can discover my VM I need to disable the windows firewall. I do this by going into the windows search bar and searching wf.msc. Once inside the windows firewall, I begin disabling everything. I then open up CMD in my native computer and try to ping the VM again. This time it receives replies from the VM because the firewall is no longer blocking ICMP requests.</b> <br/>

<br />
<p align="center">
<b>Now that my VM is exposed to the internet I can begin the setup of my PowerShell script. It is the heart of this project. This PowerShell script will parse Event Viewer specifically looking for EventID 4625. It will then send the IP address from the failed logon attempts to the website IPgeolocation.io via an API. The reason I did this is because the IP address in event viewer does not contain any geographical location. It was easier to send the data to a system dedicated to pulling that information out and sending it back to myself rather than building it from scratch. The PowerShell script will then receive all that georgraphical data and save it as a string in a logfile named failed_rdp.log. I will use this logfile later on in the project to be able to map the attacks live in Microsoft Sentinel.</b> <br/>

<p align="center">
<b>At this point to test if the PowerShell script is working, I failed another logon attempt. As you can see someone has already found my VM and started to try and bruteforce it. This person was in Tunisia. They found it so fast, it was a bit annoying. I could have blocked his IP or enabled the firewall again until I was finished completely with my setup but this data was perfect to train the AI in Azure, so I let it go at the time. In hindsight it was a bad move. The free API from IPgeolocation.io only allowed for 1000 calls. This person in Tunisia hit that limit very quickly, ruining my project. I had to pay $15 for an extra 150k API calls to save my project.</b> <br/>

<b>Now that I know my PowerShell script is working as it should, I head over to Log Analytics Workbooks to create a custom log so that I can bring my failed_rdp log into Log Analytics. In Log Analytics I navigate to my VM and create a Legacy Custom Log. It asks for a sample log, which is inside the VM. I can't download the logfile from the VM to my native computer, so I have to open the logfile inside the VM, copy the contents, go back to my native computer and open Notepad, paste the copied contents in and save the file to my desktop.

<b>Next it asks for the collection path. The collection path is where the log actually lives in the VM, so it is asking for a path that Log Analytics can take to reach that logfile.

<b>To create the map I need to add a query. Remember, I need to query the data and the fields from Log Analytics. Basically I'm pointing out the dataset I want Microsoft Sentinel to use. In the query I tell it to specifically exclude (!=) the data points that include "Samplehost" since those aren't real attacks and I don't want them to populate on the map. </b>  <br/>

<b>After I queried the data points I want, I now have to choose how I want to express/visualize them. In this case I want them visualized as a map! I choose the map setting and then configure the map to plot the attacks by latitude/longitude. I could do it by country but some of the attacks coming through was not including the country. I change the metric settings to make the bubbles bigger using the event counts. The more events the bigger the bubble. I apply the settings and my map is done!</b>  <br/>

<b>After a few hours and right before I decided to stop the project, you can see that there was a total of 10,529 attacks or failed login attempts. 20 were in the USA which was me testing the PowerShell script, 9 from Cambodia, and a whopping 10.5k from Tunisia. They were using automated brute-forcing software to try thousands of different password combinations and usernames. There was even more attempts but my PowerShell script had to be stopped and started multiple times. This is why it's important to use strong passwords and uncommon usernames! The second picture is the number of API calls I had that day.</b>  <br/>
